        <p>In an AI-based wildlife conservation platform, image processing plays a crucial role in monitoring and tracking wildlife populations. Here's a description of how image processing is utilized in such a platform:
            <br>
            <br>
            1.Camera Traps Deployment: Camera traps are strategically placed in wildlife habitats to capture images and videos of animals in their natural environment. These camera traps continuously capture images at regular intervals, generating a vast amount of raw data.
            <br>
            <br>
            2.Image Acquisition: The images captured by camera traps are collected and fed into the AI system for processing. These images may vary in quality, lighting conditions, and background clutter, presenting challenges for automated analysis.
            <br>
            <br>
            3.Image Preprocessing: Preprocessing techniques are applied to the raw images to enhance their quality and extract relevant features. This may involve tasks such as noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and image stabilization to improve the overall clarity of the images.</p>
