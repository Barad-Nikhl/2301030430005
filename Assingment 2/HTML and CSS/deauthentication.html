        <p>Deauthentication, also known as logout or session termination, is an important aspect of security in AI-based wildlife conservation platforms. Deauthentication refers to the process of terminating a user's active session and revoking their access to the platform and its resources. Here's a description of deauthentication in the context of AI in wildlife conservation:
            <br>
            <br>
            1.User Session Management: When a user logs into the wildlife conservation platform, a session is established, allowing them to access the platform's functionalities and data. The session typically remains active for a specific duration or until the user explicitly logs out or the session expires due to inactivity.
            <br>
            <br>
            2.Logout Functionality: Deauthentication is initiated when a user chooses to log out of the platform voluntarily. This action can be triggered by the user clicking on a "Logout" button or link provided within the platform's user interface. Upon logging out, the platform terminates the user's session and revokes their access to protected resources.
            <br>
            <br>
            3.Automatic Session Timeout: To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access resulting from prolonged periods of inactivity, AI-based wildlife conservation platforms often implement automatic session timeout mechanisms. These mechanisms automatically terminate idle sessions after a predefined period of inactivity, requiring users to log in again to regain access.</p>
